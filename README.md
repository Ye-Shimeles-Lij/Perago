# Perago
# Project for Perago internship.
This project is intended to show an organizational hierarchy.
The project is done using ASP.NET CORE for Web API development, Postgress for database and Postman to test the API.

( PS: As a frontend developer, i dont have much experience working with DotNet, most of the things i know about working with dotnet are to develope a website in Asp.net . 

I understand this project will not suffice, but I am willing to learn and better myself for future work.
